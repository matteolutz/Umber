## What is Umber

Umber is an interpreted (soon multiparadigm) programming language, implemented in C++. It's currently _WIP_ so please use it on your own risk. Future commits **WILL** probably contain **BREAKING CHANGES**.

## How to use it

### Build

First you have to clone the repository and build the executable from the sources:

```
git clone https://github.com/matteolutz/Umber
cd Umber
cmake --build .
```

Now you can copy the file in `{YOUR_ARCH}\Deubg|Release\Sandbox.exe` anywhere you want, to execute it.

### Run a file

```
.\Sandbox.exe <name of the file>
```

### Start a live interpreted console

```
.\Sandbox.exe
```
